A pretty GUI wrapper for [kyros-core](https://github.com/some1and2-XC/kyros-core)
## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to make it easier for users to interact with the CLI functionality of the [kyros-core](https://github.com/some1and2-XC/kyros-core) program. 
## Getting Started
If no releases exist, the only way of running this program is to compile it yourself.
To do so there are a few prerequisites that are needed. Note that any command must be run within the context of the root directory of the application. 

### Compiler & runtime requirements
1. The [rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
### Package requirements
To install all the packages required, run the following. 
1. `npm install`
### Running the application
 - For fast initialization, use the `npm run tauri dev` command. 
 - For creating a build (might take a few minutes) use the `npm run tauri build` command. 

## Status
This project is currently in development with no stable releases yet.
## Tech Stack
